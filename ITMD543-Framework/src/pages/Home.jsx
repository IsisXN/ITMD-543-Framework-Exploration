      <p>This project showcases my exploration of React with Vite. The goal was to create a small functional portfolio website with multiple pages, routing, and styling.</p>
      <p>Challenges I faced included figuring out React Router, setting up CSS properly, and learning how to display images with hover effects. Some things didn’t work at first, like importing Bootstrap before installing it.</p>
      <p>Overall, this assignment helped me understand how to structure a React project and implement navigation and styling for a clean, modern website.</p>
    </div>
